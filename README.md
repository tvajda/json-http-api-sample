## Sample Node.js JSON HTTP API

Sample Node.js-based JSON HTTP API with following services:

* **POST** `/registration`
  * name: String
  * email: String 

  Creates a new user in a database with a token, and sends an email to the user.
  The email contains a link with the token to the `/users` endpoint.
  Email address is validated before user is created in the database. In case of failure the service returns an error. 

* **GET** `/users`
  * token: String

  Lists all the registered users in the database. The `/users` endpoint is only accessible with a valid user token.

## Notes

- JSON HTTP API spec requires mime type "application/vnd.api+json" but Restify can't handle it out of the box ATM. Due to time constraints the sample uses "application/json" instead.

- Database is MongoDB

- Tokens are generated by JWT from ID field of user collection

## Sample calls

    # curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Accept: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"John Adams\", \"email\":\"john@example.com\"}" http://localhost:3000/api/registration

    # curl -v -H "Accept: application/json"  http://localhost:3000/api/users/eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.IjU0ZDhiOTM1ZDgzNGY1MjgwNGRkY2E0ZiI._0vG4F8TUZ-YgsSby2StLiwLYOJ7OAChLCYxX_2PAd0
